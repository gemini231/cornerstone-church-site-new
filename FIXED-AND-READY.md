# ✅ YOUR CODE IS FIXED AND READY FOR VERCEL!

## 🎉 SUCCESS! ALL CODE CHANGES COMPLETE!

I've successfully updated your website code to work with Vercel deployment. All `figma:asset` imports have been removed and replaced with `/public` folder paths.

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED

### **4 Files Updated:**

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `/src/app/components/Navigation.tsx` | Now uses `/logo.png` | ✅ Fixed |

## 📋 YOUR SIMPLE TO-DO LIST

To get your website live on Vercel with images showing:

### **1. Save 3 Images (2 minutes)**

Save these images from your Figma Make preview:

- **`logo.png`** - The church logo (from navigation/footer)
- **`pastor.png`** - Pastor Ademola's photo (from About section)
- **`favicon.png`** - Favicon icon (can be same as logo)

**How:** Right-click each image in preview → "Save image as..."

---

### **2. Create `/public` Folder (30 seconds)**

In your project root (where `package.json` is), create a folder called `public`

---

### **3. Add Images to `/public` (30 seconds)**

Put all 3 images inside the `/public` folder:

```
your-project/
├── public/
│   ├── logo.png
│   ├── pastor.png
│   └── favicon.png
```

**Important:** File names must be exactly `logo.png`, `pastor.png`, `favicon.png` (lowercase!)

---

### **4. Test Locally (1 minute)**

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Check that all images show in the preview.

---

### **5. Deploy to Vercel (2 minutes)**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add church images"
git push
```

Then go to https://vercel.com, import your repo, and click "Deploy"
